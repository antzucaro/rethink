      <p>Xonotic uses an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) channel to coordinate games
      between players and teams. To join or request a game, register yourself with
      the pickup bot that sits in the channel using the commands below.</p>

      <h4>Common Commands</h4>

      <ul>
        <li><b>!pickups</b> - Lists all available gametypes for pickup, e.g. tdm, 3v3ca, 5v5ctf and so on.</li>
        <li><b>!who</b> - Show players who have added up for pickup games.</li>
        <li><b>!add [game(s)]</b> - Add up for a pickup game, i.e. announce that you're wanting to play a pickup game soon. You have to specify a game to add up to, e.g. tdm, 3v3ca, 5v5ctf, duel and so on.</li>
        <li><b>!remove [game(s)]</b> - Remove yourself from a pickup game. If no arguments are provided, this command removes you from all games you have added up to.</li>
        <li><b>!renew</b> - Renew your pickup games. You're required to renew your add-up within some time interval (currently one hour), to keep people from essentially leaving the channel (afk'ing) and not being available once a pickup game starts.</li>
        <li><b>!promote [game(s)]</b> - Show a public message promoting the given pickup game. This feature is supposed to gather enough players to start a pickup game, e.g. if just one or two players are missing.</li>
        <li><b>!register <xonstat-id></b> - Register your IRC nick with the given XonStat account. The id is the number you see in the URL of your XonStat profile. A public message will be displayed if you successfully register.</li>
        <li><b>!info <nick></b> - Show XonStat info about some registered player. This command uses an IRC nick to look up the XonStat info.</li>
        <li><b>!listplayers</b> - List all users that have registered so far.</li>
        <li><b>!whois <xonstat-id></b> - Show all IRC users that have registered to the given XonStat account (remember that more than one user can register to the same account).</li>
      </ul>
