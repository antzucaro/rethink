Hello folks!

As you could read previously, there's an [online 1on1 tournament](http://www.xonotic.org/2011/10/xonotic-1v1-tournament-by-bot/) on the fly, organised by the **[BOT] clan**. The groups are already played out, and the combatants have moved on to the brackets stage (you can read about this a lot more in detail soon in _WoX-BloX issue # 2_! ;) ).
Though the matches don't have set dates, there are always a lot spectators watching over the duels with great attention. As **Antibody** [once promised](http://forums.xonotic.org/showthread.php?tid=2177&pid=30671#pid30671), he has done an audio commentary of a duel between two experienced Xonotic players: **kojn** and **fisume**.

Have fun watching!
