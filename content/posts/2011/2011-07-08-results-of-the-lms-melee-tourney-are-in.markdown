A fun time was had by all in our first-ever last man standing, melee-only tournament! After many rounds of fish-smacking fun, the results are in and vipus is the victor! You can check out the detailed results [here](https://spreadsheets.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?hl=en_US&key=0Aq5_LWlKbsDvdGstUVFONUJLTWVQZkFwWXd1T0dpRWc&hl=en_US&gid=3). Thanks to all for participating.

Vipus, it is time to wash your hands - they smell like trout!
