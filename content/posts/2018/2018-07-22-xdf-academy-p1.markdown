Yesterday [Dekry][dekry] and [Donald][donald] streamed a knowledge-sharing session about XDF, which employs a 
completely different physics configuration from the default or "vanilla" in Xonotic. There's a 
treasure-trove of topics covered. From the video's description:

1. Strafing (Gaining speed) 
2. Starting the run (Circle jumps/prejumps) 
3. Strafe turning (technique for making turns at high speeds) 
4. Overaiming (technique for dropping speed on super tight turns) 
5. Wall strafing (use walls to accelerate) 
6. Slick surfaces (map specific feature, allowing us to slide like on the ice) 
7. Dealing with obstacles and map elements (ramps/jump pads/teles)

Check it out! For more information, be sure to stop by the XDF section of [Discord][discord xdf].

Thanks for covering this complex and fun aspect of the game, Dekry and Donald!
