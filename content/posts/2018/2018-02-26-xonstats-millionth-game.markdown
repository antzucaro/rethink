XonStat has recorded its millionth game! Our game count totals have
been steadily rising over the past two years as they inched closer and closer towards that magical
seven-digit number. Now it has come and gone with the conclusion of an unbalanced [1v1 CTF
match][millionth game]. Little did Kult and Sandoz know that they were taking part in history! It's
a shame that I couldn't shower them with in-game confetti or something...

Astute link-watchers will note that this match doesn't have the exact ID of 1000000. The reason for
that is pretty simple: plain old human error! It took quite a while before all the bugs were worked
out of the system, and in the mean time the ID ticker in our trusty database kept on increasing (without a care in the
world, you could say). Through much trial, error, and finger-crossing, we now have the relatively
stable system you've come to know and love (or hate, or whatever it is you feel towards stats). 

All of these games obviously wouldn't be possible without this wonderful community, so thanks!
Without all of you enjoying yourselves playing our little game, I wouldn't get such delight at
looking at the latest numbers at the top of the XonStat landing page every morning. Frag on, 
friends, and here's to those ever-increasing numbers.
