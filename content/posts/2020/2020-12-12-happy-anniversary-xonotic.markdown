Greetings everybody! This year marks the tenth anniversary since the first commit was pushed to
Xonotic's repositories, ten long years and still going strong! It's truly incredible to
see just how far the game has come during that time, many battles fought and friends made
along the way.

Before we get too sentimental about the old days though, let's take a look at what's been
going on and what there is moving forward, shall we?

First of all, let's talk briefly about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). I'm sure
many of you are familiar with this regulation, either as privacy buffs or through those cookie
pop-ups you see on most websites nowadays... in short, the GDPR is a law that passed to
protect the privacy of users on the internet, to ensure you are not tracked without giving
your consent.

Now that we have that cleared up, let's move on to how this has any bearing on an
open source game like Xonotic:

Thanks to the amazing work of [Antibody][Antibody], we've had the privilege of being able to
keep track of our matches and the servers we enjoy playing on since all the way back in 2011
with [XonStats][XonStats]. The game simply would not be the same without this incredible resource!
However, with the GDPR act in place, we face an issue of maintaining a convenient gaming experience
while ensuring nothing is done with your information without consent. In fact, this issue is so
important to us that we've chosen not to release a new version of Xonotic without making sure the
game complies with these new legal requirements.

Rest assured though; Xonotic is [far from dead][Xonotic activity]! The brightest members of this
community have been working on the issues preventing a release from happening, while the rest
of us have been hard at work to ensure Xonotic 0.8.3 will be well worth the wait. The patience
and support from the amazing individuals surrounding this community has been a tremendous help in
keeping spirits up through these challenging times.

That just about does it for the rambling here, let me just finish up by saying:  Happy Anniversary Xonotic!
Season's greetings to you all and keep on fraggin'.
