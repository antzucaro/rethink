Hi everyone! While I was idle at my computer on this blog during the
holidays (and far beforehand as well), my good friends [Smilecythe][Smilecythe] and [Dodger][Dodger] were busy crafting 
two amazing frag videos for our viewing pleasure. Grab your popcorn and have a look!

...now that you've watched them, let me just say:  what a treat, right? Thank you Smilecythe
and Dodger for the incredible gameplay footage.
