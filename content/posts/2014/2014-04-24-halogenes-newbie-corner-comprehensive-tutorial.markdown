Good news everyone! I have updated, revised and combined the previous [Newbie Corner blog posts](http://www.xonotic.org/tag/newbie) and generated a comprehensive Newbie Tutorial out of them. Initially I wanted to post the result here, but it turned out to be too much to be comfortably readable for a single blog post. So Samual came up with the idea to put it onto the wiki, where I can easily update it whenever needed - and so I did.

New features include (but are not limited to)
	
  * an illustrated bunny hopping section with a step by step illustration of strafe turning,
  * showing ramp jumps on the map Glowplant, and
  * Crylink running added to crylink description!

You can access the entire Tutorial [here](http://dev.xonotic.org/projects/xonotic/wiki/Halogene%27s_Newbie_Corner). Enjoy!
