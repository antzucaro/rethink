Hello all!


No, Xonotic 0.6 is not released yet. We have another kind of good news. ;)




Past experiences show, that while the development of Xonotic is constant and very fruitfull, it is not very transparent. We fully understand that reading [git commit logs](http://git.xonotic.org/) or [follow activities on the developer tracker](http://dev.xonotic.org/projects/xonotic/activity) is not what you'd like to do to get the latest news about fixed bugs, added / reworked features, new maps etc. Not to mention all the community buzz going on the [official forums](http://forums.xonotic.org/index.php). This is not very user friendly, not to mention it takes a lot time to go through all the exciting new stuff around Xonotic like the [1on1 tournament](http://forums.xonotic.org/showthread.php?tid=2177) and [new player statistics testing](http://srv02.xonotic.org:6543/)!




For the sake of solving [persisting popularity issues](http://forums.xonotic.org/showthread.php?tid=2243) (don't say we don't listen to our people ;) ) we've decided that from now on, we'll be providing a lot more information in this very weblog about the latest happenings a digested way, every once in a while, probably in weekly issues.





### Ladies and Gentlemen, we present you:

**The WoX-BloX! News about Xonotic, development, and the community!**




We'll share with you insider informations about development, screenshots, videos, developer interviews, community buzz and many more!


Stay tuned fellas, be sure to check back later this week!
