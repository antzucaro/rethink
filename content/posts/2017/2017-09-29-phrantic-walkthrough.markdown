I had some free time last night, so I dusted off the old microphone and did a map review and 
walkthrough of phrantic! Made by cortez, the map is a reimagination of the classic Quake 3 CPMA 
map with several twists specific to Xonotic. It's visually beautiful and geared 
towards deathmatch. Check it out!

Great job, cortez!
