I am excited to announce the start of this year's duel mapping contest! Maps
are a huge aspect of Xonotic, so the more we have the merrier. Several gracious
community members have already contributed funds which will form the prize
money for the top-ranked maps. Donations are still open, so please consider
donating to the cause! You can find out more about the mechanics of the contest in the [official forum
thread](http://forums.xonotic.org/showthread.php?tid=5450&pid=71748#pid71748).

I can't wait to see what kind of creative things come out of this. I'd also
like to send a "hi / good luck & have fun" to all the participants. My trigger
finger is getting itchy just thinking about it!
