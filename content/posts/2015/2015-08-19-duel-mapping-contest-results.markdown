The [2015 duel mapping contest](http://forums.xonotic.org/showthread.php?tid=5450&pid=71748#pid71748) has come to a close, and as a result Xonotic has
six new and wonderful maps! Congratulations are in order for Justin, who took home first
prize with his entry Erbium. He will receive 100 EUR and a SteelSeries keyboard
for his efforts.

I also took the liberty to load all of these maps up on my local machine to create a
video walkthrough for each of these creations. You can view the
