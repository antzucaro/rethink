#### Feature Highlights

Here are some feature highlights from this release:

<a href="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_atelier.jpg"><img src="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_atelier_t.jpg" title="Atelier" class="left th m10"></a>The first of the new maps is Atelier, by ShadoW. It's been a TDM favorite for a long time, but only recently did we tidy it up for actual inclusion in the game. Sporting ample room for movement and an always-tantalizing quad spawn, this one is great for 3v3 or more.

<a href="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_final_rage.jpg"><img src="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_final_rage_t.jpg" title="Final Rage" class="right th m10"></a>The second of our new maps is a resurrected classic from the days of old: Final Rage! Heavily modified by LO and proraide, the map is sporting an entirely new look. This version of final rage is sure to witness more frags. Be wary of the warpzone on the bottom floor, though - sneaky rockets abound! This map is great for duels.

<a href="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_warfare.jpg"><img src="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_warfare_t.jpg" title="Warfare" class="left th m10"></a>The last of our new maps is another blast from the past: Warfare! Maddin has added an entirely new atmospheric feel to it along with numerous other niceties. His attention to detail is immediately apparent. This map is another good one for duels. Be careful not to get caught in the trap near the mega health!

<a href="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_luma.jpg"><img src="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_luma_t.jpg" title="Luma" class="right th m10"></a>We have an entirely new menu theme - Luma - courtesy of sev. Emphasizing strong lines and crisp visual clarity, it gives the game even more UI polish. In addition to Luma, sev has also graciously updated the Xolonium font to better comply with standards and also designed a new crosshair set.

<a href="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_itemstime.jpg"><img src="/m/uploads/2015/08/8point1_itemstime_t.jpg" title="Items timing in the HUD" class="left th m10"></a>Developer terencehill wanted to provide opportunities for players to improve their gameplay, so he introduced mega-item timers for the HUD in this release. With these enabled in the HUD players can see when the next mega item (100 health or 100 armor, to name two) is spawning next. This is great for beginners and casters alike.

Our wily core developer Mario was busy working on CTF and thought to himself "why stop at two flags?". Before we even knew what was happening he introduced three and even four flag CTF! Crazy, I tell you. Crazy fun, that is. For the sake of completeness he also implemented a one-flag CTF mode which was inspired by some Quake 3 mods. As if this weren't enough, Mario also turned his attention to the buff subsystem. This release features three all-new buffs: Inferno, Magnet, and Swapper. The buff system also received some balancing attention after community feedback. Buffs now have time limits and some of them have compensating disabilities to balance out your new powers.

Once again, the team would like to express their thanks to the community. Without you all, none of this would be possible. We'll see you out on the servers. Happy fragging!
