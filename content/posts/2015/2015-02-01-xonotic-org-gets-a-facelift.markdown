I'm really excited to unveil the new design of Xonotic.org today! While our previous site served us well for years, it was becoming a chore to keep it up to date and responsive. The version you are currently browsing is statically generated, greatly simplifying a number of things about its management. I have attempted to make it visually beautiful while keeping it functional and open at the same time. You can check the full source right now on [GitHub](https://github.com/antzucaro/rethink). I'll be sharing more information about how to collaborate on the new site soon. I hope you all enjoy!
