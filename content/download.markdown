### <a name="system-requirements"></a>System requirements

**Official builds support these platforms:**<br/>
Windows: XP or newer, 32 and 64 bit<br/>
Linux: x86_64<br/>
macOS: Intel 64 bit<br/>

Xonotic can run on other platforms if you compile the darkplaces engine yourself.<br/>

**Minimum GPU:** OpenGL 2.1 (hardware accelerated)<br/>
Xonotic can run on OpenGL 1.x GPUs but this is unlikely to be a good experience.<br/>

**Minimum memory: 2GB**<br/>
- Xonotic is playable with 2GB RAM if all programs are closed including Steam and other "system tray" entries<br/>
- Under Linux, use a "light" desktop environment to save some RAM<br/>
- Swap space/virtual memory must be enabled<br/>
- Integrated GPUs use some RAM, you might be able to adjust this in BIOS settings<br/>
- Some servers may have custom content that requires more memory<br/>
- Git builds require more than 2GB RAM for the uncompressed textures<br/>

### <a name="upgrading"></a>Upgrading from an older version

Since Xonotic version 0.5 we've offered an auto-update tool that will seamlessly upgrade your client to the latest release, provided you're using an official release or autobuild to begin with. You can find this tool in your Xonotic application directory. To use it, start by navigating to the misc->tools->rsync-updater subdirectory, then double-click (or otherwise execute in a terminal) the "update-to-release.sh" inside this directory. There is also a "update-to-release.bat" script for Windows users. This script will examine your installation and update only the files needed to bring your copy up to date using the "rsync" tool. In no time you'll have a shiny new client with which to play!

A release build with JPEG textures, instead of DDS textures with S3 compression. This build has a smaller file size and is compatible with old open source GPU drivers that lack S3TC support. It uses significantly more RAM and has longer loading times.
