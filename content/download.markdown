### Upgrading from an older version

Since Xonotic version 0.5 we've offered an auto-update tool that will seamlessly upgrade your client to the latest release, provided you're using an official release or autobuild to begin with. You can find this tool in your Xonotic application directory. To use it, start by navigating to the misc->tools->rsync-updater subdirectory, then double-click (or otherwise execute in a terminal) the "update-to-release.sh" inside this directory. There is also a "update-to-release.bat" script for Windows users. This script will examine your installation and update only the files needed to bring your copy up to date using the "rsync" tool. In no time you'll have a shiny new client with which to play!
