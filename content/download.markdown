### <a name="system-requirements"></a>System requirements

Release builds support Windows XP or newer (32 and 64 bit), Linux x86_64 and macOS x86_64.<br/>
Xonotic can be run on other platforms if you compile the included DarkPlaces engine source code yourself.

##### At least an OpenGL 2.1 GPU

##### At least 4GB of memory
Xonotic might be playable with less memory, but system tweaks may be required.

### <a name="upgrading"></a>Upgrading from an older version

Since Xonotic version 0.5, an auto-update tool is included in the Xonotic application directory.

To use it, navigate to the *misc->tools->rsync-updater* subdirectory, then double-click (or execute in a terminal) the `update-to-release.sh` (Linux/Mac) script, or the `update-to-release.bat` (Windows) script.

This script will examine your installation and update only the files needed to bring your copy up to date using the `rsync` tool. In no time you'll have a shiny new client with which to play!

### <a name="extra-downloads"></a>Extra downloads

**<a name="netradiant"></a>[NetRadiant Mapping Support download (181MB)](https://dl.xonotic.org/xonotic-0.8.2-mappingsupport.zip)**  
The official Xonotic map editor with all the assets required to create maps. This download only contains binaries for Windows, users of macOS and Linux will need to compile the included source code.  

**<a name="netradiant-illwieckz"></a>[illwieckzâ€™s NetRadiant builds](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/page/download)**  
Recent NetRadiant binaries built by illwieckz for Windows and Linux. This is a much newer version of the NetRadiant program than is found in the 0.8.2 Mapping Support download. The assets are not included so you also need the above Mapping Support pack.

**<a name="lower-quality"></a>[Lower quality Xonotic download (708MB)](https://dl.xonotic.org/xonotic-0.8.2-low.zip)**  
A release build with JPEG textures, instead of DDS textures with S3 compression. This build has a smaller file size and is compatible with old open source GPU drivers that lack S3TC support. It uses significantly more RAM and has longer loading times.  

**<a name="source"></a>[Source code download (7MB)](https://dl.xonotic.org/xonotic-0.8.2-source.zip)**  
The source of all code parts (also included with the other downloads).
