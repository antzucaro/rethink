The main official chat rooms are linked below.  There are [many others](https://gitlab.com/xonotic/xonotic/-/wikis/Channels), some with specific topics.

Please consider [these tips](https://github.com/fizerkhan/irc-etiquette#readme) when asking a question.  [This one](https://github.com/fizerkhan/irc-etiquette#give-others-a-chance-to-answer) is especially important. Many people are logged in all the time but only check messages every few hours, and only respond to questions they can help with.  
Most questions will be answered if you are patient, polite, clear, and don't break [rules](/rules).
