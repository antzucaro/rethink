This is a rethink of Xonotic's main website. It uses [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) so it's simple and
static, making administration and ongoing maintenance a good deal easier.

# For development

[Install Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing)

Run it in the xonotic.org repo's root: `hugo server --watch`

It will offer a [localhost link](http://localhost:1313/) to preview the site and the page(s) will be refreshed automatically when you save a change.
