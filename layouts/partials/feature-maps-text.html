<h3>New and Classic Maps</h3>

<h5>Xonotic ships ready to play with 25 official maps, with dozens of
community-made ones just a click away. Classic Nexuiz maps are also
supported, including those converted from Quake 3!</h5>

<h5>Those interested in making maps of their own can use our map editor,
which also ships with the game.</h5>
